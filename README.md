## Introduction - project's aim

This project is meant to tell a story, in a funny and friendly way.

You can visit it on [Costin's website](https://mywebsite-c.netlify.app/)

## Technologies
**React**

**HTML & SCSS**

**Firebase**


I used firebase for authentication and user scores storage on the pokemon flipping game.


## What I learned?

In general, I learnt how SVGs work and how to manipulate them. Also, the flipping game was another oportunity to learn and develop my mindset to be able to transform an idea into reality by javascript code.

## Functionalities

A pokemon memory game, which gives you 10 points for finding 2 identical cards or substract 1 point if the second card selected doesn't match with the first one. The "PLAY AGAIN" button shuffles the cards but keeps the score, you can play as a guest or you can create an account and get displayed on the scoreboard. Can you beat those scores?
